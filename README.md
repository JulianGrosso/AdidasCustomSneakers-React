# Adidas Custom Sneakers with React & Three.js

### [Live Demo](https://adidascustomsneakers.netlify.app/)

_Disclaimer: This project was done for educational purposes only._

This project is an interactive experience built with React and Three.js.<br>
<br>
It is part of an educational exercise in which I simulate the case of a brand (in this case Adidas), which requires a web app that allows potential customers to customize their sneakers.<br>
